Welcome to my website. I am Vu Le Tran, an experienced Quantitative Investment researcher specializing in empirical asset pricing, ESG, sustainable investment, and machine learning.

I am also an experienced practitioner in the investment industry with a solid foundation in risk management, fund management, investment management, portfolio management, and Python/R programming. I was the key contributor to the fund management and operation of [NorQuant Multi-Asset](https://markets.ft.com/data/funds/tearsheet/summary?s=SE0014957916:NOK) and NorQuant ESG mutual funds.

Additionally, I am honored to serve as a board member for the [Norwegian Association for Quantitative Finance](https://nfkf.no/). I am always seeking new opportunities to apply my expertise in a dynamic and innovative environment. Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to exploring the possibilities together.
